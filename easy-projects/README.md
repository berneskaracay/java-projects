The Story:

Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the 
problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.

Task Overview:

You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
on is the number of people on the bus.
wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus.
If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

Usage Examples:

enough(10, 5, 5)

0 -- He can fit all 5 passengers

enough(100, 60, 50)

10 -- He can't fit 10 of the 50 waiting

You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

For example, if n = 10:

return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.
