## class_1

Create a public class called Cube without a constructor which gets one single private Integer variable Side, a getter GetSide() and a setter SetSide(int num) method for this property. Actually, getter and setter methods are not the common way to write this code in C#. In the next kata of this series, we gonna refactor the code and make it a bit more professional... Note: There's no need to check for negative values!

## class_2

According to the creation myths of the Abrahamic religions, Adam and Eve were the first Humans to wander the Earth.

You have to do God's job. The creation method must return an array of length 2 containing objects (representing Adam and Eve). The first object in the array should be an instance of the class Man. The second should be an instance of the class Woman. Both objects have to be subclasses of Human. Your job is to implement the Human, Man and Woman classes.

## class_3

Color Ghost
Create a class Ghost

Ghost objects are instantiated without any arguments.

Ghost objects are given a random color attribute of white" or "yellow" or "purple" or "red" when instantiated
